# Docker, Containers, Windows Server Containers

Unfortunately the Docker client does not work on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows (something to do with Unix pipes), let alone the Docker 
engine. It's quicker and easier to install Docker for Windows. On Windows 10 or Windows Server this uses Hyper-V (not Virtual Box) 
and is a seamless experience.
